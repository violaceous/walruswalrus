title: Why Bother With a Blog?

It has been over three years now since I left development to become a product manager. A lot can happen in the technology world in three years. Javascript has gone from being a somewhat interesting space to an all-consuming complete stack. Dependency management isn't quite the horrible mess it used to be. Programming and production environments are actually manageable now. But of course all of these advancements are new technologies and concepts that I was only exposed to a high level. I'm behind the times. 

But resources learning have evolved just as quickly as technology. It is now rare for me to run into an issue that I can't solve on [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com). Angular.js is a breeze to figure out thanks to [egghead.io](egghead.io) videos and [David Mosher's youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/vidjadavemo). Slashdot is dead but Hacker News provides me with better information than Slashdot ever did. 

Yet one thing that has remained constant is that one of the very best resources in learning something is to find a blog post from someone who had the very same issue or idea that you did and who took the time to write it up. And given how frequently the same issue pops back up from reinstalls, new setups, deploying on a friends machine, and so on - documenting solutions means I won't have to remember how I solved something in the past but can instead just look here. 

I'm not going to be blazing any new theoretical ground here. I'm not the most advanced developer in the world right now nor am I likely to get there very quickly. I can still remember most of my theory, like how to implement a merge sort, but I'd probably need to check the python reference docs when implementing it. But writing something up forces you to be organized about it which is reason enough to do it. And I've been helped by many peoples' posts over the years so hopefully maybe one or two people will find some utility in one of mine.
