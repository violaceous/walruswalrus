title: Good Enough

Something I've gotten much better about after spending time on the product management side of the fence is knowing when something is good enough. I could have spent a fair amount of time fussing about the details of the layout of this blog and adding better support for tagging, search functionality, and so on. Instead I put it live without even having a contact page finished. 

* I am very unlikely to have any significant traffic for a while so the impact if I am incorrect and the current stage is not good enough is very minimal.
* Rebuilding and redeploying the site is an extremely low effort endeavor so the cost of improving is negligible which makes incremental improvements a viable option.
* The main function of a blog is the dissemination of information NOT for everyone to look at how pretty everything looks.
* Having the blog posted makes it easier for me to get feedback from friends and colleagues. 
* Working on an unvalidated product (even if it is something as straightforward as a blog) is risky. Getting validation on the initial cut reduces that risk.
* The sooner I get started throwing up posts the quicker I will bang the rust off my somewhat atrophied writing skills. 

So there is basically no risk to me pushing up what is a functional but very rough blog. However the posts themselves are a different story. While updating the blog framework itself applies across the entire blog, having the need to improve a particular post requires me to go back and specifically spend time on just that post. Writing posts that will require future attention accumulates a debt that is time consuming to address and does not scale well. So the effort I should be spending is on the quality of my content and not on the way it is displayed. If the display were to be so bad as to interfere with the readability of the content then that would be an issue. And in time I will want to address the organization and findability of my content as well but for now with very few posts those are not priorities.

Plus time I spend working on this blog is time I don't spend working on my other projects, or more importantly - climbing rocks. And nothing makes me practice good time management better than not having enough time for climbing rocks.
