title: Github is Tricky

I have been wondering for a bit now why I haven't been getting a streak going on github despite how much I have been committing code. I like using things like that for building a habit. In June I started meditating twice a day for twenty minutes each time and just by trying to keep a streak alive I am now at 129 days of meditation. So naturally I want to bring that same level of success to my coding.

The help docs on github talked about commits not blaming the right person if the email addresses don't match up. Mine looked fine - until I realized that the email address github shows on my public profile may in fact be (and in my case was) different than the one the account is actually setup with. Whoops - don't I feel stupid (I don't really - that should be called out in the help documentation; user's only make the mistakes they're allowed to make). Now to start my streak.
